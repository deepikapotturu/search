###Scope

The application searches for the word in a text file given by the user via UI. You can find words with alphabets and numbers. 
I have used the maximum time (8 hours)

### If I were given more time I would have:

1. Tried to implement the Levenshtein algorithm in my own way
2. Configured more appealing error page
3. Validated user input in a strict way 
4. Made frontend more appealing
